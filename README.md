# Risk Review Analysis Dashboard
## Project Objectives
The Risk Review Analysis Dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of risk status within projects using interactive data visualization. By analyzing risk data, stakeholders can make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate potential risks.

## Purpose
The purpose of this dashboard is to enable stakeholders to quickly assess and respond to risks in real-time. It allows for efficient risk management by identifying and addressing issues before they escalate.

## Importance
The Risk Review Analysis Dashboard is crucial for project success. By visualizing risk data, teams can prioritize mitigation efforts, allocate resources effectively, and ensure project delivery within acceptable risk thresholds.

## Role of Reports
Reports play a vital role in communicating insights from data analytics. The Risk Review Analysis Dashboard provides actionable information to project managers, team leads, and other stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making.

## Dashboard Highlights
  - **Trend View:** This view provides a historical trend analysis of risk-related metrics. It likely includes line charts or time-series graphs showing how risk factors have evolved over time. Stakeholders can identify patterns, spikes, or dips in risk levels.
  - **Trend Monthly View:** Similar to the trend view, this section focuses specifically on monthly trends. It may break down risk data by month, allowing stakeholders to track variations and seasonality in risk occurrences.
  - **Detail View:** The detail view provides a granular look at individual risks. It could include a table or list of specific risks, their descriptions, impact levels, and mitigation plans. Stakeholders can drill down into specific risk items for deeper analysis.
  - **Risk View:** This section likely visualizes risks based on different criteria, such as risk type, product/IP, or function. It may include pie charts, bar graphs, or other visualizations to show the distribution of risks across categories.
  - **Risk Status Analysis View:** Here, stakeholders can see the status of each risk. It might include horizontal bars or a stacked bar chart showing the number of risks in various states (e.g., accepted, mitigated, unresolved).

## Key Learnings
